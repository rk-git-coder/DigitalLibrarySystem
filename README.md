Challenges Faced & Future Improvements
🚧 Challenges Faced:
Handling Errors: Ensuring proper validation for user inputs (e.g., preventing duplicate book entries, handling invalid inputs).

Data Persistence: Currently, the system does not store book data permanently (i.e., once the program exits, all data is lost).

User-Friendly Experience: The console interface is functional but could be improved for better usability.

🚀 Future Improvements:
File Storage or Database Integration: Implement a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) or file storage (e.g., JSON, CSV) to retain book data.

GUI Version: Upgrade the system using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more interactive user experience.

Advanced Search & Filters: Allow users to search books based on multiple filters like genre, author, and availability status.

User Authentication: Implement a login system to differentiate between librarians and regular users with different permissions.
